# pr-agent-model-preflight.sh: before PR-Agent runs, find the first model of its
# DECLARED chain that NaN answers (AI-045, #1763).
#
# Measured 2026-09-30. NaN retired `mimo-v2.5`, PR-Agent's primary. For hours
# it accepted the diff and never answered, and PR-Agent then exited cleanly
# with nothing published: a green `review` job and no review, on every PR
# (#1107). After that it answered 401, "This API key does not have access to
# the requested model". PR-Agent's own fallback handles a refusal. It does not
# handle a hang, which holds the run for the full inference timeout on each
# retry. Neither case tells anyone that the declared model is dead.
#
# This probes each model once, with a small request and a timeout. It hands
# PR-Agent the first model that answers, followed by the remaining models that
# answered, in declared order. Every model that did not answer becomes a
# `::warning::` and a line in the job summary, naming the files to fix. If
# none answers, the job fails with `::error::` before PR-Agent starts.
#
# It never CHOOSES a model. The chain is declared in the workflow and in
# .pr_agent.toml (a test holds the two equal), and this only skips dead entries
# in that order. The draw among the members that answered is
# scripts/pr-agent-route.sh's (AI-045 AC9). Anything outside the chain is never considered, whatever NaN
# serves: `GET /v1/models` lists what the cluster runs, not what the key may
# call (https://nan.builders/docs/choose-a-model), so only a real call counts.
#
# The key goes to curl on stdin (`-K -`), never on its argv, where any process
# on the runner could read it.
#
# Usage:
#   pr-agent-model-preflight.sh --model openai/<id> --fallbacks '["openai/<id>", ...]'
#                               [--output FILE]
#
# Env:
#   NAN_API_KEY        the key (required; never printed)
#   NAN_API_BASE       default https://api.nan.builders/v1
#   PREFLIGHT_TIMEOUT  seconds per model, default 90
#   GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY  when set, a table of the probe results is appended
#
# Output, as `key=value` lines to --output (default stdout):
#   model=<first model that answered>
#   fallbacks=<JSON array of the other models that answered, in declared order>
#
# Exit:
#   0  a model answered
#   1  no declared model answered (the review pool continues without NaN)
#   2  usage or setup error
