# pr-agent-route.sh: draw which pool member reviews this PR first (AI-045 AC9,
# #1923).
#
# The CI review pool is harness/reviewer-pool.json's members that carry a
# `pr_agent` block: the NaN chain the preflight declares
# (scripts/pr-agent-model-preflight.sh, a test holds the two equal), Haiku, and
# Sonnet. Members that answered their probe are drawn by their `weight`, so the
# share each one gets is a number in that file, not an accident of how many
# members there are. A member that did not answer (dead, over quota, saturated,
# no credential) is not in the draw, and its weight is shared out among the rest
# in proportion.
#
# Sonnet (`route: risk`) is never drawn. It reviews first when the PR crosses
# `pr_agent_risk`: additions plus deletions at or above `min_changed_lines`, or
# the label. If it does not answer, the PR goes to the draw with a note; the
# quality tier being over its spend limit never means no review.
#
# One PR-Agent attempt talks to ONE provider: PR-Agent's own fallback chain
# shares one transport, and NaN's (`LITELLM__CUSTOM_LLM_PROVIDER: openai`, its
# base URL) would misroute an Anthropic model. So the draw picks the provider of
# the first attempt and, within NaN, the model; the other provider, when one of
# its members answered, is the second attempt. The workflow runs that second
# attempt only on a measured absence of a published review.
#
# The Anthropic models CI may spend on are ALLOWED below, not read from the pool:
# the Console cannot restrict a key to a model, so this list is the allowlist,
# and a pool edit naming another model fails the draw instead of paying for it.
#
# PR_AGENT_PROVIDER (a repository variable) overrides the draw:
#   draw (or unset)  by weight over every member that answered, risk first
#   nan              NaN first, Anthropic second, no risk route
#   anthropic        Anthropic first, NaN second
#   nan-only         NaN only; no Anthropic model is even probed, so this is
#                    the switch that stops all spending on the Anthropic key
# A forced provider with no member that answered falls back to the draw, with a
# warning: forcing is for testing a route, and a review is still worth having.
# An unknown value fails: it may be a misspelt `nan-only`, and spending against
# a switch someone meant to turn off is the one outcome this must not produce.
#
# The key goes to curl on stdin (`-K -`), never on its argv.
#
# Env:
#   POOL_FILE              default harness/reviewer-pool.json
#   NAN_OUTCOME            the preflight step's outcome (`success` when a NaN model answered)
#   NAN_MODEL              the preflight's first NaN model that answered
#   NAN_FALLBACKS          JSON array of the other NaN models that answered, in declared order
#   NAN_PREFLIGHT_EXIT     the preflight's exit code; 2 (a broken setup) fails the draw
#   PR_AGENT_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  the Anthropic key; empty means no Anthropic member (never printed)
#   PR_AGENT_PROVIDER      the override above
#   PR_CHANGED_LINES       additions plus deletions; empty when unread (risk then by label only)
#   PR_LABELS              JSON array of the PR's label names
#   PR_AGENT_DRAW          tests only: a point in [0, total weight) instead of a random one
#   ANTHROPIC_API_BASE     default https://api.anthropic.com
#   ROUTE_PROBE_TIMEOUT    seconds for each Anthropic probe, default 30
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY      names the repository in the remedy
#   GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY    when set, the draw is appended to it
#
# Output, as `key=value` lines to --output (default stdout):
#   first=nan|anthropic|none     the provider of the first attempt
#   second=nan|anthropic|none    the provider of the attempt after it
#   reviewer=<model>             the member that reviews first
#   route=draw|risk              how it was chosen
#   nan_model=<model>            the NaN attempt's model, when NaN is first or second
#   nan_fallbacks=<JSON array>   the NaN attempt's fallback chain
#   anthropic_model=<model>      the Anthropic attempt's model, when Anthropic is first or second
#   anthropic_effort=<effort>    its reasoning effort
#   note=<text>                  why a member was out of the draw, for the final guard
#
# Exit: 0 routed (first may be `none`), 1 unknown PR_AGENT_PROVIDER, a NaN
