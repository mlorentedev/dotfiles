# pr-agent-publish-guard.sh: did THIS run of the pr-agent workflow publish a
# review? (#1107, AI-045 AC9, #1923)
#
# One definition of "published", two callers in .github/workflows/pr-agent.yml:
#
#   --probe --output FILE
#       Between the first attempt and the second (one per provider of the
#       review pool, scripts/pr-agent-route.sh). Appends `published=true`,
#       `published=false` or `published=unknown` to FILE and exits 0. Only a
#       measured `false` lets the second attempt run: a second review cannot
#       duplicate a first one that does not exist. `unknown` (the API failed,
#       or no marker is declared) never runs it.
#
#   (no arguments)
#       The final guard. Exits 0 only when a review was published, and names
#       the attempt that ran last when one was not.
#
# PR-Agent swallows a failed inference into a clean exit (run 32325012314:
# green job, no review, a NaN concurrency 429). ADR-032's top tier "queues or
# escalates, NEVER degrades silently", so a run that published nothing fails.
#
# A review is a comment that is all three of: authored by github-actions[bot]
# (on a public repo anyone can paste the marker text), created or edited at or
# after this run's start stamp (`persistent_comment` edits the earlier Guide,
# which moves `updated_at`), and carrying a marker the reviewer registry
# declares, read at the DEFAULT branch, since a PR could redefine its own.
#
# Env: GH_TOKEN, GITHUB_REPOSITORY, PR_NUMBER, BASE_REF, STARTED, HEAD_SHA
# (empty on issue_comment runs). The final guard also reads ATTEMPTS, one
# `<outcome> <model>` line per attempt in execution order (`skipped` or empty
# for one that did not run), and ROUTE_NOTE (why a pool member was out of the
# draw). GUARD_RETRY_SECONDS shortens the retry backoff in tests.
